# NClass

NClass is a free tool to easily create UML class diagrams with C# and Java language support. The user interface is designed to be simple and user-friendly for easy and fast development. Initially the project was developed by the great Balasz Tihanyi on [sourceforge](http://nclass.sourceforge.net/), but the project has gone inactive due the lack of time. 

Still, NClass is a great tool, although it is missing some important features. The goal of this project is to restart the development of NClass, adding the missing features. 

## Existing features

 - C# and Java support with many language specific elements
 - Simple and easy to use user interface
 - Inline class editors with syntactic parsers for easy and fast editing
 - Source code generation
 - Reverse engineering from .NET assemblies (thanks to Malte Ried)
 - Configurable diagram styles
 - Printing / saving to image
 - Multilingual user interface
 - Mono support for non-Windows users

## Some of the things to come

  - Bringing the NClass' support of C# and Java up-to-date with current version of the languages
  - Sequence diagrams
  - Use Case diagrams
  - Undo/Redo
  - Many more to come. If you have an idea, don't hesitate to open an issue
