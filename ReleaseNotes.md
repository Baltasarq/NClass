# Release 2.7.0 - the release nobody wanted

This is release 2.7.0, some of the highlights
 - You can do now use case diagrams
 - NClass is now using updated and homebrewn NReflect
 - The projects targets now net472
 - Copy and paste should finally be working correctly
 - Some of the code areas are now covered by unit tests
 - Bunch of small miscellanios fixes

 I'm going to continue the development with my tectonic speed, so buckle down.
 What I'm going to do focus on in the following release will be:
  - some basic undo/redo functionallity
  - improve the assembly import/code validation
  - maven support for java projects generation
  - dotnet core support for csharp projects genration

This of course can change

Thank you very much for the patience and the support of contributors.
